Description

Cancer is the 2nd commonest cause of death in children in the developed countries with an estimated 15,780 children diagnosed each year in the U.S. Malignant cancer death rates have improved over the years due to more effective treatment. By analyzing pediatric cancer patient data, it can be determined which variables may influence survival.

This project uses data from the SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results) Program to analyze which variables influence survival of pediatric cancer patients. The total number of patients is 69,263 who were diagnosed with malignant cancer between the years of 2000 and 2018. The variables analyzed were age, gender, year diagnosed, race, tumor site, median household income, rural-urban code, survival months, and cause of death.
